<div class="MiniHeading centered">Simple definition of "Intellectual Property"</div>

<p class="paragraphpadding">Intellectual property refers to any legal rights (and/or copyright) of individuals' intellectual creativity/creation (original/new work made by the individual) such as; art, scripts, designs, music, images, names, or any original concept.</p>

<div class="MiniHeading centered">An Example of Intellectual Property</div>

<p class="centered madethisart">I made this art</p>

<img src="images_2025/artmadebyme.png" alt="very awesome art" class="PictureCenterMINI">

<p class="paragraphpadding">This art is my original creation and I own it, no one can just take it, use and make money off of it as it has my copyright and I could sue the person who stole it.</p>

<p class="paragraphpadding">Anyone who doesn't own the copyright or any legal rights to my art cannot use it to make money as it is my property, as it will be plagiarism.</p>

<p class="paragraphpadding">If you want to use it, you'll have to follow a set of rules to be able to use it. Rules like: giving me credit, paying me for the IP, or asking for permission.</p>

<div class="MiniHeading centered">A more advanced definition</div>

<p class="paragraphpadding">
    * Intellectual property (aka IP) refers to the legal rights of the creation made by individuals in the internet. These creations can include music made by musical artists, visual art made by visual artists, models made by 3D artists, games made by developers, inventions made by engineers who posts it online and websites made by scripter.
</p>

<p class="paragraphpadding">* Users on the internet cannot use an IP made by the creator, as if they do, they will face copyright strikes. IPs cannot be used by any user who doesn't have permissions or can't reach the requirements, and if they still used the IP, it would be called plagiarism.</p>

<p class="paragraphpadding">* If users would like to use an IP, they would need to follow a set of rules, documents or must reach the requirements. For example: You must pay me to be able to use my art/IP. You must at least credit me to use my art/IP. You must follow a set of rules in a doc I made for the permissions of my IPs (Usually three). You must simply ask permission from me.</p>

<p class="paragraphpadding">* If the user has followed the set of rules or was given permission to use it, they now have rights to make money off of it (If was allowed) or to just use it.</p>

<div class="MiniHeading centered">A more simpler definition and extra details</div>

<p class="paragraphpadding">A more simpler way in defining IPs is that they're basically the property of creators. Online art can be an IP, HTML5 games are IPs, music can be an IP.</p>

<P class="paragraphpadding">IPs prevent from users in the internet from using them, needing them to follow a set of rules before they can be used or be given permission to be used.</P>

<div class="MiniHeading centered paragraphpadding">Summary</div>

<p class="paragraphpadding">If I made an IP/original creation, it's mine, if I didn't make it, it isn't mine. If I want to use an IP/original creation that isn't mine, I would need to ask permission or reach requirements to use it.</p>
