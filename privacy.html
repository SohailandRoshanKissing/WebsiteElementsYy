    Privacy
</h1>

<p>The definition of online privacy is the level of privacy protection an individual has while
    connected to the Internet. It covers the amount of online security available for personal and
    financial data, communications, and preferences.</p>

    <p>Formal Definition of Privacy on a Website:</p>

    <p>Privacy on a website refers to the protection of personal information that is collected, used,
    disclosed, and stored by a website or its third-party service providers. This personal information
    includes any data that can identify an individual, such as name, address, email, phone number,
    and financial information. Protecting privacy on a website involves compliance with data
    protection laws and regulations, as well as the implementation of technical and organizational
    measures to ensure that personal information is kept confidential, secure, and used only for
    lawful purposes.</p>
